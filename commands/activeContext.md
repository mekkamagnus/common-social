# Active Context: Common Social

## Current Work Focus
**Building standalone executable and optimizing deployment**

### Immediate Priority
- **Build System**: Complete `ros build` integration for compiled executable
- **Server Optimization**: Main single-file server is running and production-ready
- **Distribution**: Create deployable binary without Roswell dependency

### Recent Changes
1. **Memory Optimization**: Solved heap exhaustion by creating single-file server
2. **Proper Shebang**: Implemented correct Roswell script format for reliable execution
3. **Main Server**: Replaced complex modular system with working single-file approach
4. **Live Testing**: Server running with real users posting and browsing
5. **Build Exploration**: Investigating `ros build` for standalone executable compilation

## Next Steps

### Critical Path
1. **Complete Build System**: Resolve `ros build` issues for standalone executable
2. **Documentation**: Update all guides to reflect single-file architecture
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark compiled vs interpreted server performance
4. **Distribution**: Create installation package for easy deployment

### Optional Enhancements
- Magic link authentication for multi-user support
- Enhanced UI features and themes
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Advanced social features (following, likes, etc.)
- Real-time updates with WebSockets

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Choices
- **Single-File over Modular**: Eliminates memory issues, simplifies deployment
- **Direct Execution over Complex Loading**: Proper shebang enables simple `./run.lisp`
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Sufficient for MVP, easier deployment
- **HTMX over React/Vue**: Fits Lisp philosophy, minimal JavaScript
- **Blue Theme**: Clean, professional appearance for production use

### Development Patterns
- **Memory-First Design**: Prioritize minimal resource usage and fast startup
- **Single-File Development**: All functionality in one file for easy debugging
- **Direct Execution**: Simple `./run.lisp` command for immediate server start
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries (hunchentoot, sqlite, cl-who)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
```lisp
;; Type checking pattern
(defun create-post (user-id content)
  (declare (type integer user-id)
           (type post-content content))
  (validate-and-assert content 'post-content "Invalid post content")
  ;; Implementation...
  )

;; HTML generation pattern
(cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (*standard-output* nil)
  (:div :class "component-class"
   ;; Content...
   ))
```

### Database Patterns
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Type constraints at database level
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection

### UI Patterns
- Dark emerald theme (`*theme*` = "emerald", `*dark-mode*` = t)
- HTMX for all dynamic interactions
- Tailwind utility classes
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Hot Loading**: Dramatically improves development speed
2. **Type System**: Catches errors early, improves reliability
3. **CL-WHO Integration**: HTML generation feels natural in Lisp
4. **HTMX**: Perfect fit for server-rendered dynamic apps
5. **SQLite**: Fast enough for development, easy to manage

### Challenges Discovered
1. **Complex HTML Functions**: Large render functions are hard to debug
2. **Parentheses Balance**: CL-WHO nesting can get complex
3. **Error Messages**: Syntax errors in templates are hard to locate
4. **Development Flow**: Need better tooling for template debugging

### Key Insights
- Phase 2 social features are architecturally sound
- Database design supports future scaling
- Hot loading is essential for Lisp web development
- Type safety prevents entire classes of bugs
- HTMX + Tailwind is an excellent combination for Lisp
