# Active Context: Common Social

## Current Work Focus
**Fixing Phase 2 syntax issues to deploy enhanced social features**

### Immediate Priority
- **Syntax Debugging**: enhanced-app.lisp has parentheses balance errors preventing deployment
- **Phase 2 Deployment**: All features are coded but can't run due to CL-WHO syntax issues
- **User Testing**: Need working app to validate social features

### Recent Changes
1. **Template Migration**: Successfully converted from Djula to CL-WHO
2. **Phase 2 Implementation**: Added users, profiles, likes, follows, notifications
3. **Database Schema**: Comprehensive relational design with proper constraints
4. **Type Safety**: Implemented throughout with custom validators
5. **Dark Theme**: Hot-swappable emerald theme system

## Next Steps

### Critical Path
1. **Fix Syntax Issues**: Debug parentheses in render-posts function (line ~504)
2. **Deploy Phase 2**: Get enhanced-app.lisp running on port 8008/8009
3. **User Testing**: Validate social interactions work correctly
4. **Performance Check**: Ensure database queries are efficient

### Phase 2 Completion
- Magic link authentication system
- Image upload functionality
- Enhanced notifications UI
- User search and discovery
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Choices
- **CL-WHO over Djula**: Better type integration, hot loading compatibility
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Sufficient for MVP, easier deployment
- **HTMX over React/Vue**: Fits Lisp philosophy, minimal JavaScript
- **Dark Theme Default**: Modern aesthetic, reduces eye strain

### Development Patterns
- **Type-First Design**: All functions have comprehensive type checking
- **Hot Loading Development**: Changes apply instantly without restart
- **Functional Core**: Business logic is pure, side effects at boundaries
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI building blocks

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
```lisp
;; Type checking pattern
(defun create-post (user-id content)
  (declare (type integer user-id)
           (type post-content content))
  (validate-and-assert content 'post-content "Invalid post content")
  ;; Implementation...
  )

;; HTML generation pattern
(cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (*standard-output* nil)
  (:div :class "component-class"
   ;; Content...
   ))
```

### Database Patterns
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Type constraints at database level
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection

### UI Patterns
- Dark emerald theme (`*theme*` = "emerald", `*dark-mode*` = t)
- HTMX for all dynamic interactions
- Tailwind utility classes
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Hot Loading**: Dramatically improves development speed
2. **Type System**: Catches errors early, improves reliability
3. **CL-WHO Integration**: HTML generation feels natural in Lisp
4. **HTMX**: Perfect fit for server-rendered dynamic apps
5. **SQLite**: Fast enough for development, easy to manage

### Challenges Discovered
1. **Complex HTML Functions**: Large render functions are hard to debug
2. **Parentheses Balance**: CL-WHO nesting can get complex
3. **Error Messages**: Syntax errors in templates are hard to locate
4. **Development Flow**: Need better tooling for template debugging

### Key Insights
- Phase 2 social features are architecturally sound
- Database design supports future scaling
- Hot loading is essential for Lisp web development
- Type safety prevents entire classes of bugs
- HTMX + Tailwind is an excellent combination for Lisp

## Current Status Summary
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete and working
- **Phase 2**: ðŸ”§ Features implemented, syntax issues preventing deployment
- **Database**: âœ… Schema complete with proper relationships
- **Hot Loading**: âœ… Working for theme changes
- **Type Safety**: âœ… Comprehensive throughout codebase
- **UI**: âœ… Dark emerald theme, responsive design

**Critical Issue**: Parentheses balance in enhanced-app.lisp render-posts function preventing Phase 2 from running.
